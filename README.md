This is the library app for The Odin Project's full stack JavaScript course.

This project is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

There is not much functionality in this app - rather its main purpose is to combine the above 3 technologies as a learning exercise to meet the requirements set by TOP. 

How it works:

    - The library starts out empty, click 'add book' to create a new book.
    - In the form that appears, fill out all 3 fields and click 'add to library'.
    - A new card will be created and then displayed for that book.
    - You can add as many books as you like by following this method
    - You can mark books as read (which also updates the book object)
    - You can remove any book by clicking the 'remove' button
